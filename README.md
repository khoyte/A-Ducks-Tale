*A Duck Tail* is a short 2d side scrolling adventure game made in Unity Engine where the player plays as a duck and must find water in an everchanging 
and unfamiliar world. Our game addresses the destruction of natural habitats by humans and the effect it has on the local wildlife. This project was 
created for DIG 4813 Contemporary Topics in Digital Media taught by Edwin Lohmeyer at the University of Central Florida. All art in the game is original and created by Gary Carrasco.
